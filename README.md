tmTheme to Pygment Styles (CSS)
===============================

Here is a stupid script that makes a "best attempt" at extracting 
textmate/sublime colour themes and converts them into a pygment style 
to be used with Jekyll and what-have-you.

Theme files that have been tested (a very limited selection) with this script
are ones that are found at:

<http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/>

##Usage##

Run `python tmTheme2pygment.py inputColourScheme.tmTheme ~/Desktop/output.css`
Replace the first argument with the location of the tmTheme file you downloaded from the link above.
Replace the second argument with where you want to output the css file.

Or if you want to batch convert a bunch at a time you can use this.
```
find . -name '*.tmTheme' | sed 's/\.tmTheme$//' | xargs -I FILE_NAME python tmTheme2pygment.py "FILE_NAME.tmTheme" "FILE_NAME.css"
```
